# About

<i><b>What I cannot create, I do not understand</b> - Richard Feynman</i>
</p>

Ever since I played with Lego as a little child, I’ve been fascinated with automation, robotics, and teaching machines to be useful in general.
Nowadays, I would summarize my passion as the science of **efficient machine-comprehensible problem formulation**, which I try to apply to estimation and control problems on autonomous drones.
