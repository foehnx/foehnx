I'm a robotics engineer with focus on real-time systems and a passion for elegant and scalable solutions to real-world problems.

Automation fascinated me ever since I played with Lego as a little child.<br>
However, by experience I learned that the best solutions are usually the simple ones.<br>
Not the easy ones, but the simple, elegant, readable yet impressive ones.

I've done my PhD with the "Robotics and Perception Group" led by Prof. Davide Scaramuzza at the University of Zurich. My research is focused on control systems for vision-based aerial vehicles with prospects towards machine learning.

In my master studies at the ETH ZÃ¼rich in "Robotics, Systems and Control" I also worked with autonomous vehicles and electric drive systems. I've completed my master thesis on model predictive control for quadrotors and a semester thesis on interaction with quadrotors.

During my bachelor in "Mechanical and Process Engineering" I participated in the "Formula Student Electric" project at the ETH ZÃ¼rich with the "academic motorsport association ZÃ¼rich", short AMZ. For two consecutive years I could gather experience in team work under time pressure, first as an automotive engineer in control systems and then as CTO leading the electrical development of a race car.
I've extended this experience in my master by supervising a team of 10 students working on an autonomous race car for demonstration purposes, developed in a one-year project under the lead of Prof. Roland Siegwart.

State-of-the-art approaches in quadrotor control split the problem into multiple cascaded subproblems, exploiting the different time scales of the rotational and translational dynamics. They calculate a desired acceleration as input for a cascaded attitude controller but omit the attitude dynamics. These approaches use limits on the desired acceleration to maintain feasibility and robustness through the control cascade. We propose an implementation of an LQR controller, which: (I) is linearized depending on the quadrotorâ€™s state; (II) unifies the control of rotational and translational states; (III) handles time-varying system dynamics and control parameters. Our implementation is efficient enough to compute the full linearization and solution of the LQR at a minimum of 10 Hz on the vehicle using a common ARM processor. We show four successful experiments: (I) controlling at hover state with large disturbances; (II) tracking along a trajectory; (III) tracking along an infeasible trajectory; (IV) tracking along a trajectory with disturbances. All the experiments were done using only onboard visual inertial state estimation and LQR computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation and evaluation of a state-dependent LQR capable of onboard computation while providing this amount of versatility and performance.
